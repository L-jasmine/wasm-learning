# The json I/O example

In this example, we demonstrate how to use JSON to call Rust functions in SSVM from JavaScript. Read about [Rust Functions in Node.js](https://www.secondstate.io/articles/rust-functions-in-nodejs/).

## Prerequisites

If you have not done so already, follow these simple instructions to [install Rust, Node.js, SSVM, and ssvmup](https://www.secondstate.io/articles/setup-rust-nodejs/).


## Create new project

```
$ cargo new --lib json_io
$ cd json_io
```

## Change the cargo config file

The [Cargo.toml](Cargo.toml) file shows the dependencies. Note the dependency for wasm-bindgen, which is required for invoking these Rust functions from JavaScript. The dependency for serde and serde-json allows us to work with JSON strings to represent complex data types.

## Write Rust code

The [src/lib.rs](src/lib.rs) file contains a few Rust functions that showcase using JSON for input / output parameters. Multiple parameters and return values are represented in tuples.

## Build the WASM bytecode

```
$ ssvmup build --enable-aot
```

## Node.js app

The [node/app.js](node/app.js) file shows how to call the Rust functions, running inside the Second State VM (SSVM), from JavaScript inside Node.js.

## Test

```
node app.js
```

## Result

```
