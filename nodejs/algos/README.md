# Visulizing Machine Learning Algos

> To draw SVG graphs in Rust, we used the techniques described by [Cetra](https://cetra3.github.io/blog/) in [this article](https://cetra3.github.io/blog/drawing-svg-graphs-rust/).

## Prerequisites

If you have not done so already, follow these simple instructions to [install Rust, Node.js, SSVM, and ssvmup](https://www.secondstate.io/articles/setup-rust-nodejs/).

## Build the WASM bytecode

```
$ ssvmup build
```

## Run the Node.js app

```
$ cd node
$ node server.js
```

## User testing

Point your browser to http://localhost:8080/, and follow the instructions.
